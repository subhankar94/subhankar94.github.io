					<br><br>I'm a student at New York University's College of Arts & Sciences, majoring in Mathematics & Computer Science.<br>
					If resumés make your heart go <!-- <span style="letter-spacing:-0.5pt; font-size:14px;"> lub-dub-lub-dub-lub-dub</span> --> racing,  here is <a href="Files/Subhankar_Resume.pdf">mine</a>.<br>
			
					<br>If it's still the Summer of 2015, then I'm a Decision Sciences Intern at <a href="http://www.capitalfloat.com">Capital Float</a> Digital SME Finance, where I build things that aid the various decision making processes in the company, from lead prioritization to underwriting.<br>

					<br>However if it is the Fall of 2015, perhaps because you hitched a ride in a suspiciously retro futuristic DeLorean, then I'm back to being a Learning Assistant at NYU's 
					<a href="http://www.nyu.edu/students/undergraduates/academic-services/undergraduate-advisement/academic-resource-center/tutoring-and-learning.html"> University Learning Center</a>, where I tutor Math, CS, Economics, Sociology, and occasionaly offer writing tips to the daring.<br><br>

				<div id="SOMETIME">
					<br>Before I "knew lots of business terms like 'meeting' and 'envelope'":<br>		
						
					<br>I was born and raised in Bangalore; spent 4 years in a Singaporean boarding school courtesy of the good people at A*STAR and Raffles Institution; and then moved to New York to attend NYU.<br>

					<br>I enjoy taking photographs, looking at photographs, though not so much being in photographs. If you'd like to see some of them, check out my <a href="">tumblr</a>, or my <a href="https://instagram.com/subhankar94/">Instagram</a>. I make a mean lasagna. Although if I'm doing it alone, with cast iron pots, ceramic baking pans and an uncooperative rolling pin, it can take me a good 3 hours. Also since all the kids are talking about it, I stand firm with east coast better than no coast.<br>

				<div id="LAST"><br>
					<br>When I last updated this page:<br><br>

				<div id="HOW"><br>
