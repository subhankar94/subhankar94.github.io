				<p>I'm a student at New York University's College of Arts & Sciences, majoring in Mathematics & Computer Science.</p>
		
				<p>If it's still the Summer of 2015, then I'm a Decision Sciences Intern at <a href="http://www.capitalfloat.com">
					Capital Float</a>, where I help make things that help make decisions, or help make things that make decisions.
					Yes, that sounds about right.</p>

				<p>However if it is the Fall of 2015, because you hitched a ride in a suspiciously retro futuristic DeLorean or just 
					because time sort of does that, then I'm back to being a Learning Assistant at NYU's 
					<a href="http://www.nyu.edu/students/undergraduates/academic-services/undergraduate-advisement/academic-resource-center/tutoring-and-learning.html">
					University Learning Center</a>, where I tutor Math, CS, Econ, Sociology, and occasionaly offer writing tips to the daring.</p>

				<p>If resum√©s get your heart racing, here is <a href="">mine</a>.</p>

				<p class="heading">BEFORE I "KNEW LOTS OF BUSINESS TERMS LIKE 'MEETING' AND 'ENVELOPE'"<p>		
					
				<p>I was born and raised in Bangalore; spent 4 years in a Singaporean boarding school courtesy of the good people
					at A*STAR and Raffles Institution; and then in an attempt to better understand the meaning of "antipodal", 
					moved to New York. Also since all the kids are talking about it, 
					I stand firm with east coast better than no coast.</p>

				<p>I enjoy taking photographs, looking at photographs, though not so much being in photographs. If you'd like to see 
					some of them, check out my <a href="">tumblr</a>, or my <a href="https://instagram.com/subhankar94/">Instagram</a>. 
					Also, I make a mean lasagna. Although if I'm doing it alone, with cast iron pots, ceramic baking pans and an 
					uncooperative rolling pin, it can take me a good 3 hours. (So, apologies if you have asked but not received.)</p>
					
				<p>Don't worry. I mean, who isn't? But if it helps, you can find some of the faux-fancy computer code
					I've written at <a href="https://github.com/subhankar94">GitHub</a> and my professional (there goes my
					shot at the olympics) profile on <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/subhankar94">LinkedIn</a>. If you'd like
					to get in touch with me--for advice or something--tweet at me on 
					<a href="http://www.twitter.com/subhankar94">Twitter</a>, or send me an 
					<a href="mailto:subhankar.ghosh@nyu.edu">email</a> if you prefer mediocre advice served up longform.</p>
