		<p>I'm a student at New York University's College of Arts & Sciences, majoring in Mathematics & Computer Science.
			I was born and raised in Bangalore till I was 14; won a scholarship to attend Raffles Institution and 
			spent 4 years in a Singaporean boarding school; and then in a feeble attempt to better understand the meaning
			of "antipodal", moved to NYC, though I don't think that that's a thing. Also, east coast better than no coast.</p>

		<p>I enjoy taking photographs, looking at photographs, though not so much being in photographs. If you'd like to see 
			some of them, check out my <a href="">tumblr</a>. Also, I make a mean lasagna. Although if I'm doing it alone, with 
			cast iron pots, ceramic baking pans and an uncooperative rolling pin, it can take me a good 3 hours. (So, sorry 
			if you have asked but not received.) <!-- The automobile has always been an object of fascination, and even though
			the IC engine is so 2 centuries ago, there are still some cars of that ilk that can make me weak at the knees. --></p>

<!-- 		<p>I didn't grow up knowing I wanted to do Math & CS.<br>Here is a what-I'm-going-to-study timeline:<br>
			2007: Architecture or Industrial Design<br>
			2008: Probably Architecture or Industrial Design<br>
			2009: Maybe Architecture or Industrial Design<br>
			2010: Maybe Economics<br>
			2011: Probably Economics<br>
			2012: Probably some combination of Economics, Political Science & Philosophy<br>
			2013: Maybe some combination of Economics, Political Science & Philosophy<br>
			2014: Maybe Economics & Computer Science<br>
			2015: Maybe Mathematics & Computer Science</p><br>
