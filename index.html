          			<br>
          			I'm a student at New York University's College of Arts & Sciences,
          			majoring in Computer Science & Mathematics.<br>
					<br>
					During the semester I work as a Learning Assistant at NYU's 
					<a href="http://www.nyu.edu/students/undergraduates/academic-services/undergraduate-advisement/academic-resource-center/tutoring-and-learning.html"> University Learning Center</a>, where I tutor Math, CS, Economics, Sociology, and occasionaly offer writing tips to the daring; I TA for an
					experimental calculus class, and will be TA-ing for a Computer Systems Organization class starting in the Fall.<br>
					<br>
					I spent this past summer researching the learning mechanisms of CNNs used for object recognition at the <a href="http://cds.nyu.edu">Center for Data Science</a> at NYU, being a Resident Assistant in one of the NYU dorms and developing teaching resources at the University Learning Center.<br>
					<br>
					Last summer I was a Decision Sciences Intern at <a href="http://www.capitalfloat.com">Capital Float</a> Digital SME Finance, where I built things that aided the various decision making processes in the company, from lead prioritization to underwriting.<br>
					<br>
          			If you're looking for advice regarding courses, resources at the university, getting
          			started with research, etc., the best way to get in touch with me is via <a href="mailto:subhankar.ghosh@nyu.edu">email</a>. You can check out the courses I've taken

				<div id="SOMETIME">
					<br>Before I "knew lots of business terms like 'meeting' and 'envelope'":<br>		
						
					<br>I was born and raised in Bangalore; spent 4 years in a Singaporean boarding school courtesy of the good people at A*STAR and Raffles Institution; and then moved to New York to attend NYU.<br>

					<br>I enjoy taking photographs, looking at photographs, though not so much being in photographs. If you'd like to see some of them, check out my <a href="https://instagram.com/subhankar94/">Instagram</a>. I make a mean lasagna. Also since all the kids are talking about it, I stand firm with east coast better than no coast.<br>
